Barebones [Ataxx](https://www.thingsesque.com/media/uploads/ataxx/index.html) game built without looking at any other ataxx games code, done as a challenge to learn how to make my own rust project. Uses [macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) to draw to the screen.

Includes a very simple engine to play against, again coded with no reference to other engines as a challenge for myself.
